# 1.Mean, Median, and Mode
<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating the mean, median, and mode. 

<h2>Task</h2>
Given an array,X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.

Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3, 7.0  format).

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer, N , denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
			<li>10<=N<=2500</li>
			<li> -1<=xi<=10^5 , where xi is the ith element of the array.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print 3 lines of output in the following order:
<ol>
			<li>Print the mean on a new line, to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3 ,7.0 ).</li>
			<li>Print the median on a new line, to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3 ,7.0 ).</li>
			<li>Print the mode on a new line; if more than one such value exists, print the numerically smallest one.</li>
</ol>

# 2.Weighted Mean

<h2>Objective</h2>
In the previous challenge, we calculated a mean. In this challenge, we practice calculating a weighted mean.

<h2>Task</h2>
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, W , representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3 format).

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer, N , denoting the number of elements in arrays X and W.
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array X.
The third line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array W.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
	<li> 5 <=N<=50</li>
	<li> -1<xi<=100, where  is the  element of array X.</li>
	<li> -1<wi<=100, where  is the  element of array W.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3 format).
