<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating quartiles.

<h2>Task</h2>
Given an array, X , of n integers, calculate the respective first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3). It is guaranteed that Q1,Q2, and Q3 are integers.

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer, n , denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
		<li>5<=n<=50</li>
		<li> -1<=xi<=100, where xi is the ith element of the array.</li>

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print 3 lines of output in the following order:

The first line should be the value of Q1.
The second line should be the value of Q2.
The third line should be the value of Q3.
