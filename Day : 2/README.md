# 1.Basic Probability
<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. 

<h2>Task</h2>
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.
<ul>
		<li>2 / 3</li>
		<li>5 / 6</li>
		<li>1 / 4</li>
		<li>1 / 6</li>
</ul>

<h3>Answer is 5 / 6</h3>

# 2.More Dice

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.


<h2>Task</h2>
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.
<ul>
			<li>1 / 9</li>
			<li>1 / 6</li>
			<li>2 / 3</li>

# 3.Compound Event Probability

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. 

<h2>Task</h2>
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.


Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?
<ul>
	<li>10 / 63</li>
	<li>2 / 7</li>
	<li>17 / 42</li>
	<li>31 / 126</li>
</ul>
You have 2 attempts left.

<h3>Answer is 17 / 42</h3>
