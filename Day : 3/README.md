# 3.Drawing Marbles

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.


<h2>Task</h2>
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?
<ul>
	<li>1 / 12</li>
	<li>7 / 12</li>
	<li>1 / 6</li>
	<li>2 / 3</li>
</ul>
