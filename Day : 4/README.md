# 1.Binomial Distribution I

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we learn about binomial distributions.

<h2>Task</h2>
The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09 : 1. If there is 1 child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly 6 children will have at least 3 boys?

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. Then print your result, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).

<h2>Input Format</h2>

A single line containing the following values:

1.09 1

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).

# 2.Binomial Distribution II

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we go further with binomial distributions.

<h2>Task</h2>
A manufacturer of metal pistons finds that, on average,12% of the pistons they manufacture are rejected because they are incorrectly sized. What is the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain:
<ol>
  <li>No more than 2 rejects?</li>
  <li>At least 2 rejects?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input Format</h2>

A single line containing the following values (denoting the respective percentage of defective pistons and the size of the current batch of pistons):

12 10

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print the answer to each question on its own line:
<ol>
    <li>The first line should contain the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain no more than 2 rejects.</li>
    <li>The second line should contain the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain at least 2 rejects.</li>
</ol>
Round both of your answers to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).

# 3.Geometric Distribution I

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we learn about geometric distributions.

<h2>Task</h2>
The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1 / 3. What is the probability that the 1st defect is found during the 5th inspection?

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator for the probability of a defect, and the second line contains the inspection we want the probability of being the first defect for:

1 3<br>
5

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).


# 4.Geometric Distribution II


<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we go further with geometric distributions. We recommend reviewing the Geometric Distribution tutorial before attempting this challenge.

<h2>Task</h2>
The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1 / 3. What is the probability that the 1st defect is found during the first 5 inspections?

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator for the probability of a defect, and the second line contains the inspection we want the probability of the first defect being discovered by:

1 3<br>
5
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).
