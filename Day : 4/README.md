# 1.Binomial Distribution I

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we learn about binomial distributions.

<h2>Task</h2>
The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09 : 1. If there is 1 child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly 6 children will have at least 3 boys?

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. Then print your result, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).

<h2>Input Format</h2>

A single line containing the following values:

1.09 1

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).
