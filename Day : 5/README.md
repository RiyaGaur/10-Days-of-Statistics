# 1.Poisson Distribution I

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we learn about Poisson distributions.

<h2>Task</h2>
A random variable, X , follows Poisson distribution with mean of 2.5. Find the probability with which the random variable X is equal to 5.

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains X's mean. The second line contains the value we want the probability for:

2.5<br>
5

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234 format).
