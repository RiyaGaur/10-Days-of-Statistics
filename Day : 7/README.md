# 1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient I


<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.

<h2>Task</h2>
Given two n-element data sets, X and Y , calculate the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient.
<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the size of data sets X and Y.
The second line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set X.
The third line contains  space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set .

<h2>Constraints</h2>

, where  is the  value of data set .
, where  is the  value of data set .
Data set  contains unique values.
Data set  contains unique values.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient, rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
