# 1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient I


<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.

<h2>Task</h2>
Given two n-element data sets, X and Y , calculate the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient.
<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the size of data sets X and Y.
The second line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set X.
The third line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set Y.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 10 <= n <=100</li>
  <li> 1 <=xi <=500, where xi is the ith value of data set X.
  <li> 1 <=yi <=500, where yi is the ith value of data set Y.
  <li>Data set X contains unique values.
  <li>Data set Y contains unique values.
</ul>
<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places.

# 2.Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. 

<h2>Task</h2>
Given two n-element data sets,X  and Y, calculate the value of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the number of values in data sets X and Y.
The second line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place) denoting data set X.
The third line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place) denoting data set Y.

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
  <li> 10 <= n <=100</li>
  <li> 1 <=xi <=500, where xi is the ith value of data set X.
  <li> 1 <=yi <=500, where yi is the ith value of data set Y.
  <li>Data set X contains unique values.
  <li>Data set Y contains unique values.
</ul>

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print the value of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places.
