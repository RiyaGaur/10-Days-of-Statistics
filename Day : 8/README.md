# 1.Least Square Regression Line

<h2>Objective</h2>
In this challenge, we practice using linear regression techniques.

<h2>Task</h2>
A group of five students enrolls in Statistics immediately after taking a Math aptitude test. Each student's Math aptitude test score, x , and Statistics course grade, y , can be expressed as the following list of (x,y)  points:
<ol>
	<li>(95 85)</li>
	<li>(85 95)</li>
	<li>(80 70)</li>
	<li>(70 65)</li>
	<li>(60 70)</li>
</ol>
If a student scored an 80 on the Math aptitude test, what grade would we expect them to achieve in Statistics? Determine the equation of the best-fit line using the least squares method, then compute and print the value of y when x=80.

<h2>Input Format</h2>

There are five lines of input; each line contains two space-separated integers describing a student's respective x and y grades:

95 85
85 95
80 70
70 65
60 70
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

<h2>Output Format</h2>

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e.,1.234  format).



# 2.Pearson Correlation Coefficient II

The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 8 = 0 , and the regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

<ul>
	<li>1</li>
	<li>-1</li>
	<li>3 / 4</li>
	<li>-4 / 3</li>
	<li>4 / 3</li>
	<li>-3 / 4</li>
</ul>
